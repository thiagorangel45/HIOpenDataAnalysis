In this repository, you will find a set of simple examples using CMSSW EDAnalyzers to extract trigger information and produce ROOT Hiforest files from CMS public heavy-ion data. This repository contains two main branches: [2010-En](https://github.com/thiagorangel45/HIOpenDataAnalysis/tree/2010-En) and [2011-Pt](https://github.com/thiagorangel45/HIOpenDataAnalysis/tree/2011-En), corresponding to the released CMS heavy-ion data for the respective years. The instructions may vary from one branch to another.
